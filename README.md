I am most excited to learn about the different data structures and their uses/applications. Most importantly, I am looking forward to being able to create efficient applications with the knowledge I am going to get from this course. I hope this will improve my knowledge of the concepts used in software and will give me a greater understanding of what it means to be a computer scientist.
